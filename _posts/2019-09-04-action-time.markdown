I’ve finally struck some realisation and inspiration to -
1. work on myself more seriously and make the best use of my past experience and my present pursuit of a master’s degree.
2. start this blog!

This month marks the third month since I started pursuing my full time masters degree in Singapore.
I attended a Job Fair today and found close to a dozen companies that suited by background and experience. I realised that when I spoke to them, I didn’t really care about the exact problem they were trying to solve but rather found myself feeling desperate to join the companies that were looking for software / data engineering positions. 

I came back home and thought about this. Why was I feeling this way? Why was I not thinking about what’s best for my skill set? Or think abut what job interest’s me? This is one mistake I did in my past two companies - I didn’t really give conscious thought about my fit but just chose it out of a certain kind of desperation.

On further introspection I realised I was feeling this way because I had no clear idea of what value I provide to company I join(ed). I dabbled with some web development (which I love) while I was in my undergrad and decided to join web developer positions after graduating. This could have been a great fit had I known the value I was providing - so that I can feel proud about what I’m building. But rather I was feeling like an imposter, often thinking that the software I’m building is not really useful to anyone (which was not the case!) and that anyone can do my job. In other terms, I did not understand how my contributions added value to the company; thus making me feel like I’m not doing anything of importance. This had an effect both my performace and self-esteem.

But the good thing is I have about 6 months of time to find a next job that fits me. 
I’ve decided to change this perception and I’ve made an action plan to overcome this problem. The following is my plan - 

1. Make a list of things I'm good at that can add value to a company (and understand scenarios where it provides good business value).
2. Match those skills to jobs in market and make a list of positions and companies that interest me.
3. Find out interesting companies and get to know about how they’re solving the problem. If I have a better solution to their problem, I can pitch what I know to them and maybe create myself a position.
3. Get really good at what I’m studying right now in my master’s degree (which is Artificial Intelligence) by doing side projects, writing blogs posts about what I’ve learnt, try to contribute to an open source project I really care about.
5. Find local meet-ups and be a regular attendee.

These are the 5 things I currently want to work on to find a job that fits me. I wrote this blog as a way to make things clearer to myself and also make me accountable.

This is going to be a good ride. Hope it all turns out well this time :)

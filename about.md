Hi, I'm Vishaag Suriyanarayanan. I'm currenly pursuing my master's degree in Intelligent Systems at the National University of Singapore. Previously I worked at Oracle and Beautiful Code as Web Developer. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I made this blog to document my leanrning journet and share my learnings.

Apart from computers I like spending time outdoors. Here's a picture of me 3 seconds before I capsized into the water from a Kayak.
